# Random-Dodge-Game

# How to play

Your goal is to avoid enemy boxes that comes from the top of the screen. You can do that by clicking spcaebar. 
Clicking spacebar is going to teleport you to a random horizontal coordinate but you will still stay in the vertical
coordinate you started with. Enemy boxes comes faster after every five seconds.

# Good Luck!
